## Design Choises
### Fonts
I have used the font 'Julius Sans One' for all the Rubrics on the site, it is a clean and soft font that match the theme. And for the rest of the texts I am using 'Roboto' just because it is nice to read and don't take any attention.
### Colors
THe colors for this site is white and different shades of purple. It is a soft and calm colour that match the theme and the product of the site. Indicate a calm feeling for the user.
